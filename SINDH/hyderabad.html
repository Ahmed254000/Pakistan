    <p>Hyderabad is a mesmerizing dichotomy between traditional, colonial architecture and a modern urban city center. Despite its modernization over the years, Hyderabad is home to myriad tombs, shrines and other landmarks reflecting its spiritualistic anchor.

Made of marble with Quranic verses and intricate Islamic design carved on them the tombs of Talpur Mirs will leave you at a loss of words.</p>
