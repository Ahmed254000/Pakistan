    <p>Multan Also known as ‘City of Saints’, Multan is a city nestled in Punjab near the Chenab River. Standing amongst the ten largest cities in Pakistan, the city is famous for being an economic and cultural hub of southern Punjab. Enriched with history for being one of the oldest cities in the Asian subcontinent, there is much to do and a lot of places to visit in Multan. With the emergence of many deluxe residential schemes and the development of an advanced Bus Rapid Transit System for public transportation in recent years, Multan is progressing at a rapid pace. At the same time, the metropolis also relishes a very amusing past, the remnants of which can be observed today. It houses a mausoleum of many Sufi figures who have influenced generations of devotees. Similar to what we see in the case of the Walled City of Lahore, Multan’s inner city is surrounded by an ancient, deteriorating wall, which was built in 1756 AD. There are different majestic gates that mark the Walled City such as Haram Gate, Bohar Gate, Delhi Gate, Lohari Gate, Dolat Gate and Pak Gate. These gates are the most famous historical attractions in Multan. Holding amazing secrets of the city’s ancient past, visiting this inner city can give you a great insight about the history buffs in Multan.</p>
